## Section 1: Learning Gains (Retain identical wording from pre for comparison)
(Likert 1=Strongly Disagree … 5=Strongly Agree)
1. I have built data workflows before.
2. I can query databases confidently.
3. I have retrieved data from REST APIs.
4. I understand principles of data cleaning and validation.
5. I can design a reproducible data structure.
6. I feel confident troubleshooting data pipeline failures.
7. I can choose appropriate tools for data acquisition.
8. I can assess data quality issues systematically.
9. I can document a pipeline for other users.

## Section 2: Knowledge Check (Same items; optional randomized order)
1. A data pipeline is best described as: (a) A single script; (b) A series of connected processes moving and transforming data; (c) A database schema; (d) A visualization tool.
2. The HTTP status code 429 indicates: (a) Success; (b) Not Found; (c) Too Many Requests; (d) Unauthorized.
3. In SQL, selecting unique values uses: (a) DISTINCT; (b) UNIQUE; (c) GROUP; (d) ONLY.
4. Best first step when cleaning a dataset: (a) Delete all NAs; (b) Profile structure and summary statistics; (c) Normalize everything; (d) Load into production.
5. An API rate limit is: (a) Maximum query complexity; (b) Restriction on number of requests per time window; (c) Disk quota; (d) Memory threshold.

## Section 3: Satisfaction (Likert 1–5)
1. The workshop met my expectations.

2. Which topic was MOST valuable? (APIs, Databases, Cleaning, Pipeline Design, Other)
3. Which topic needs more depth next time? (APIs, Databases, Cleaning, Pipeline Design, Other)
4. List one concrete change you will make to your current workflow. (long text)

## Section 5: Open Feedback
1. What was the most helpful part? (long text)
